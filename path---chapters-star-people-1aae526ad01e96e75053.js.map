theories behind the strangest celestial object in the universe: the black hole. Inside the black hole is a point in space of infinite density and infinite gravity, from which nothing, not even light, can escape. This is known as ‘the singularity’. This episode is split into four different segments, titled  ‘Parallel Reality’, ‘Worm Holes’, ‘Time In Reverse’ and ‘The Stand Still Of Time’, all soundtracked with original music composed by Jeff Mills and featuring performances by American pianist Kathleen Supové and British violinist Thomas Gould. The guest commentator for this episode is Dr. Jameson Graef Rollins of Caltech’s Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory.\",\"Dr. Rollins describes the phenomenon of black holes: \\\"Black holes are usually formed through gravitational collapse whereby very massive objects are crushed into a very small region due to their own gravity. Once an object is dense enough that even light cannot escape from its surface, there is no known force in the universe that can prevent the object from collapsing into a single point, known as a singularity. The singularity inside of a black hole is a point of an infinite curvature. The surface of no return, surrounding a black hole, is known as the ‘event horizon’. When you cross the event horizon of a black hole there is nothing capable of preventing you from falling into the singularity at its center.\\\"\"],\"credits\":[{\"title\":\"Concept/Script, Main Soundtrack, Producer and Presenter\",\"names\":[\"Jeff Mills\"]},{\"title\":\"Recorded/Edited at\",\"names\":[\"Spider Formation Miami/Paris\"]},{\"title\":\"Guest Musicians\",\"names\":[\"Kathleen Supové - Pianist, Recorded at Threshold Studio, New York\",\"Thomas Gould - Violinist, Recorded at Flesh And Bones Studio, London\"]},{\"title\":\"Guest Interview and commentary\",\"names\":[\"Dr. Jameson Graef Rollins\"]},{\"title\":\"Narration\",\"names\":[\"Vicente Solis – The Green Agency\"]},{\"title\":\"Project Coordinator, Recording and Research Assistant\",\"names\":[\"Yoko Uozumi\"]},{\"title\":\"Program Press Relations\",\"names\":[\"Elsa Sachet\"]}],\"qa\":{\"title\":\"Q&A WITH GUEST ARTISTS KATHLEEN SUPOVÉ AND THOMAS GOULD:\",\"paragraphs\":[\"How did you approach the task of musically representing the singularity inside a black hole, and how did this relate to your instrument?\",\"THOMAS GOULD: I can’t pretend that I’m any kind of expert on astrophysics or space exploration! The violin, being something like 500 years old, isn’t the first musical instrument that would spring to mind when thinking of the music of the cosmos, but it is a wonderfully versatile instrument, and subtle effects were applied to make it sound more otherworldly.\",\"KATHLEEN SUPOVÉ: I guess that I had an initial flash of an idea when I saw the respective titles, and then that flash was amplified by hearing the tracks that Jeff had already laid down. It always involved a physical gesture, at least as much as a \\\"musical\\\" motif. I guess I'm just an actor or dancer at heart… \",\"How do you think music can be best used to help people think about subjects that exceed the limits of their minds?\",\"TG: I think music provides a huge number of people an escape from the “limits of their minds”. You only have to look at how many commuters are immersed in their headphones at rush hour. Of course most of them are unlikely to be contemplating subjects that exceed the limits of their minds, but music has a unique ability to transport us from the limitations and frustrations of our actually lives and limitations.\",\"KS: I was struck by the experience of listening to this show – first of all, I hardly ever listen to radio, but it created an interesting mental space. Your mind is forced to manufacture images, but it settles down into a kind of meditative state. At some point during the show, I realized I'd \\\"gone somewhere\\\"…\",\"In what contexts do you think music is best listened to?\",\"TG: I think nothing comes close to the thrill of live music making. This is the heart of our art form and hopefully always will be. But both of my recent collaborations with Jeff have been for radio, for Radio 1 and now NTS, so that shows how important radio is in terms of creating new music, as well as spreading old.\",\"What in particular have you learned from the creative process and collaboration in The Outer Limits?\",\"KS: Well the recording session was really intense. I learned to trust my instincts and the skills I have because there was no other choice.\",\"TG: The best takes were the ones where I could immerse myself fully in the concept and switch off my critical and over-analytical side, which is always there for any classically-trained musician. So I guess I learned that you can find the greatest rewards musically when you lose yourself.\",\"What’s your next musical endeavor? \",\"KS: I'll be releasing a new album sometime this year on the Starkland label, looking to extend the piano through the use of accessories, including vocals, string manipulation, laughter, mallets and Yamaha Disklavier robotic chamber music.\",\"TG: My jazz series ‘Gould Standard’ continues at London’s Kings Place on April 13th, and before that I play a contemporary classical programme, also at Kings Place, on February 28th.\"]}},\"gallery\":[{\"title\":\"Extreme Power Of Black Hole Revealed\",\"description\":\"NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory has revealed one of the most powerful black holes known.

Leonardo didn’t receive a classical education, although his grandfather was very close as a child and took him on walks around the countryside of Vinci. He was always saying to him in Italian “po l’occhio”, which means “open your eyes”. That guided him throughout his life: to be curious and to observe… After his childhood in Vinci, Leonardo left to study in Verrocchio’s workshop – a sculptor and a painter – as he had also shown promising talent in his first drawings.\",\"Leonardo wrote in one of his notebooks that his first memory was not a family or a friend but of a bird. He writes: “the kite seems to be my destiny, because among the first recollections of my infancy, it seems to me that, as I was in my cradle, a kite came to me and opened my mouth with its tail and struck me several times with its tail inside my lips”. We know the great dream he had was to fly and so this is something that guided him all his life from his childhood.\",\"Leonardo moved from Italy to France with all notebooks, leaving them in his will to his favourite pupil, Melzi. This is the person he had the most trust in, and was certain that the notebooks would be well kept after his death. Leonardo didn’t leave anything personal but these 8000 pages of notebooks that we know today was something very intimate for him. It’s the only record of all his knowledge, because at the time his inventions were not realized, or were destroyed, or were for temporary objects that could only last a few days so we don’t have any traces of them today. Leonardo explains in several of his notebooks that his inventions were not possible for his own time, because the Renaissance didn’t have the materials or knowledge to realise them. With Leonardo’s ‘Dream of Flight’, he said that man wouldn’t have the sufficient knowledge to build a flying machine for many more years, so he projected himself and his inventions hundreds of years in the future.\",\"Despite this, Leonardo Da Vinci was living in the Renaissance, the first great age of engineering. He used the techniques of engineering in many applications: for civil use, for war, for the King, or for the Duke… but he also applied engineering to his personal inventions and dreams. He was the only person at the time to think about flight and transportation because for him, the Dream of Flight is not something to get from a point to another but for imitating birds, and that which is found in nature. In comparison with the other engineers of his time, Leonardo was the only one to be an engineer, a scientist and also an artist.\",\"When Leonardo left Italy, he was 64 years old, very old for the time, and his main competitors were two other artists aged just 20: Michaelangelo and Raphael. So he had huge competition from the next generation... He was not respectful with his commissions for deadlines and would often work with severe delays. Patrons often commissioned a painting but Leonardo wouldn’t finish it, or he would keep it for himself which led to a poor reputation. Leonardo came to France on invitation from the King, and we aren’t sure if he was working for anybody at the time in Italy. So he didn’t really have much choice: if we wanted to live in a great house with a great King – we should mention that Francis I had just won the Battle of Marignano – he had to move to France. Francis I was a very young King who loved the arts and science, and Leonardo knew that if he was working with Francis then he could work freely on his projects… Upon his arrival, Francis is said to have claimed: “here, Leonardo, you can be free to think, work and dream”.\",\"During the Renaissance era, music was linked to the humanists and the Royal Court. It was a symbolic display of power through cultural creativity. Many composers were looking to polyphonic harmony and natural symmetry, so there was something of science bleeding into music, and that can be found in Leonardo’s musical works. He was himself a musician, mainly playing an Italian instrument called the Lyra da Braccio, a string instrument most often used to accompany poetry or for improvisation. According to Vasari, Leonardo was one of the greatest players in his time...\",\"Who was Mona Lisa? She wasn’t important to Leonardo – she was a model. But her painting is one of the most important to him, because it was one of the only three paintings he took with him when he moved to France. He never wanted to leave it. Something that is often forgotten is that the painting was commissioned, but Leonardo kept it for himself and never returned back the painting to the patron who paid for it. You can see in the painting’s landscapes, the smile, the colours and pigmentations a testimony of Leonardo’s capacity for painting: “the only way to see behind what is visible, behind the soul, behind the emotion”... The last known drawing Leonardo did before his death is about time and water. At the end of his life he was fond of studying the movement of water and his attributed quote reflects this: “Water erodes the mountains and fills the valleys; if it could, it would reduce the world to a perfect sphere.”\\u2028\"]}},\"gallery\":[{\"title\":\"Self Portrait Leonardo Da Vinci\",\"description\":\"A sketched self-portrait from Leonardo Da Vinci, drawn at some point between 1512 and 1515 in his early sixties.\",\"credits\":\"Royal Library, Turin (Biblioteca Reale, Torino)\",\"imageUrl\":\"https://media2.ntslive.co.uk/resize/1600x1600/c8fdae09-8ea4-4ab9-abcf-9b3c34b93d86_1540512000.jpeg\"},{\"title\":\"Mona Lisa\",\"description\":\"The iconic portrait of Mona Lisa.

Inside the black hole is a point in space of infinite density and infinite gravity, from which nothing, not even light, can escape. This is known as ‘the singularity’. This episode is split into four different segments, titled  ‘Parallel Reality’, ‘Worm Holes’, ‘Time In Reverse’ and ‘The Stand Still Of Time’, all soundtracked with original music composed by Jeff Mills and featuring performances by American pianist Kathleen Supové and British violinist Thomas Gould. The guest commentator for this episode is Dr. Jameson Graef Rollins of Caltech’s Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory.\",\"Dr. Rollins describes the phenomenon of black holes: \\\"Black holes are usually formed through gravitational collapse whereby very massive objects are crushed into a very small region due to their own gravity. Once an object is dense enough that even light cannot escape from its surface, there is no known force in the universe that can prevent the object from collapsing into a single point, known as a singularity. The singularity inside of a black hole is a point of an infinite curvature. The surface of no return, surrounding a black hole, is known as the ‘event horizon’. When you cross the event horizon of a black hole there is nothing capable of preventing you from falling into the singularity at its center.\\\"\"],\"credits\":[{\"title\":\"Concept/Script, Main Soundtrack, Producer and Presenter\",\"names\":[\"Jeff Mills\"]},{\"title\":\"Recorded/Edited at\",\"names\":[\"Spider Formation Miami/Paris\"]},{\"title\":\"Guest Musicians\",\"names\":[\"Kathleen Supové - Pianist, Recorded at Threshold Studio, New York\",\"Thomas Gould - Violinist, Recorded at Flesh And Bones Studio, London\"]},{\"title\":\"Guest Interview and commentary\",\"names\":[\"Dr. Jameson Graef Rollins\"]},{\"title\":\"Narration\",\"names\":[\"Vicente Solis – The Green Agency\"]},{\"title\":\"Project Coordinator, Recording and Research Assistant\",\"names\":[\"Yoko Uozumi\"]},{\"title\":\"Program Press Relations\",\"names\":[\"Elsa Sachet\"]}],\"qa\":{\"title\":\"Q&A WITH GUEST ARTISTS KATHLEEN SUPOVÉ AND THOMAS GOULD:\",\"paragraphs\":[\"How did you approach the task of musically representing the singularity inside a black hole, and how did this relate to your instrument?\",\"THOMAS GOULD: I can’t pretend that I’m any kind of expert on astrophysics or space exploration! The violin, being something like 500 years old, isn’t the first musical instrument that would spring to mind when thinking of the music of the cosmos, but it is a wonderfully versatile instrument, and subtle effects were applied to make it sound more otherworldly.\",\"KATHLEEN SUPOVÉ: I guess that I had an initial flash of an idea when I saw the respective titles, and then that flash was amplified by hearing the tracks that Jeff had already laid down. It always involved a physical gesture, at least as much as a \\\"musical\\\" motif. I guess I'm just an actor or dancer at heart… \",\"How do you think music can be best used to help people think about subjects that exceed the limits of their minds?\",\"TG: I think music provides a huge number of people an escape from the “limits of their minds”. You only have to look at how many commuters are immersed in their headphones at rush hour. Of course most of them are unlikely to be contemplating subjects that exceed the limits of their minds, but music has a unique ability to transport us from the limitations and frustrations of our actually lives and limitations.\",\"KS: I was struck by the experience of listening to this show – first of all, I hardly ever listen to radio, but it created an interesting mental space. Your mind is forced to manufacture images, but it settles down into a kind of meditative state. At some point during the show, I realized I'd \\\"gone somewhere\\\"…\",\"In what contexts do you think music is best listened to?\",\"TG: I think nothing comes close to the thrill of live music making. This is the heart of our art form and hopefully always will be. But both of my recent collaborations with Jeff have been for radio, for Radio 1 and now NTS, so that shows how important radio is in terms of creating new music, as well as spreading old.\",\"What in particular have you learned from the creative process and collaboration in The Outer Limits?\",\"KS: Well the recording session was really intense. I learned to trust my instincts and the skills I have because there was no other choice.\",\"TG: The best takes were the ones where I could immerse myself fully in the concept and switch off my critical and over-analytical side, which is always there for any classically-trained musician. So I guess I learned that you can find the greatest rewards musically when you lose yourself.\",\"What’s your next musical endeavor? \",\"KS: I'll be releasing a new album sometime this year on the Starkland label, looking to extend the piano through the use of accessories, including vocals, string manipulation, laughter, mallets and Yamaha Disklavier robotic chamber music.\",\"TG: My jazz series ‘Gould Standard’ continues at London’s Kings Place on April 13th, and before that I play a contemporary classical programme, also at Kings Place, on February 28th.\"]}},\"gallery\":[{\"title\":\"Extreme Power Of Black Hole Revealed\",\"description\":\"NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory has revealed one of the most powerful black holes known.

Leonardo didn’t receive a classical education, although his grandfather was very close as a child and took him on walks around the countryside of Vinci. He was always saying to him in Italian “po l’occhio”, which means “open your eyes”. That guided him throughout his life: to be curious and to observe… After his childhood in Vinci, Leonardo left to study in Verrocchio’s workshop – a sculptor and a painter – as he had also shown promising talent in his first drawings.\",\"Leonardo wrote in one of his notebooks that his first memory was not a family or a friend but of a bird. He writes: “the kite seems to be my destiny, because among the first recollections of my infancy, it seems to me that, as I was in my cradle, a kite came to me and opened my mouth with its tail and struck me several times with its tail inside my lips”. We know the great dream he had was to fly and so this is something that guided him all his life from his childhood.\",\"Leonardo moved from Italy to France with all notebooks, leaving them in his will to his favourite pupil, Melzi. This is the person he had the most trust in, and was certain that the notebooks would be well kept after his death. Leonardo didn’t leave anything personal but these 8000 pages of notebooks that we know today was something very intimate for him. It’s the only record of all his knowledge, because at the time his inventions were not realized, or were destroyed, or were for temporary objects that could only last a few days so we don’t have any traces of them today. Leonardo explains in several of his notebooks that his inventions were not possible for his own time, because the Renaissance didn’t have the materials or knowledge to realise them. With Leonardo’s ‘Dream of Flight’, he said that man wouldn’t have the sufficient knowledge to build a flying machine for many more years, so he projected himself and his inventions hundreds of years in the future.\",\"Despite this, Leonardo Da Vinci was living in the Renaissance, the first great age of engineering. He used the techniques of engineering in many applications: for civil use, for war, for the King, or for the Duke… but he also applied engineering to his personal inventions and dreams. He was the only person at the time to think about flight and transportation because for him, the Dream of Flight is not something to get from a point to another but for imitating birds, and that which is found in nature. In comparison with the other engineers of his time, Leonardo was the only one to be an engineer, a scientist and also an artist.\",\"When Leonardo left Italy, he was 64 years old, very old for the time, and his main competitors were two other artists aged just 20: Michaelangelo and Raphael. So he had huge competition from the next generation... He was not respectful with his commissions for deadlines and would often work with severe delays. Patrons often commissioned a painting but Leonardo wouldn’t finish it, or he would keep it for himself which led to a poor reputation. Leonardo came to France on invitation from the King, and we aren’t sure if he was working for anybody at the time in Italy. So he didn’t really have much choice: if we wanted to live in a great house with a great King – we should mention that Francis I had just won the Battle of Marignano – he had to move to France. Francis I was a very young King who loved the arts and science, and Leonardo knew that if he was working with Francis then he could work freely on his projects… Upon his arrival, Francis is said to have claimed: “here, Leonardo, you can be free to think, work and dream”.\",\"During the Renaissance era, music was linked to the humanists and the Royal Court. It was a symbolic display of power through cultural creativity. Many composers were looking to polyphonic harmony and natural symmetry, so there was something of science bleeding into music, and that can be found in Leonardo’s musical works. He was himself a musician, mainly playing an Italian instrument called the Lyra da Braccio, a string instrument most often used to accompany poetry or for improvisation. According to Vasari, Leonardo was one of the greatest players in his time...\",\"Who was Mona Lisa? She wasn’t important to Leonardo – she was a model. But her painting is one of the most important to him, because it was one of the only three paintings he took with him when he moved to France. He never wanted to leave it. Something that is often forgotten is that the painting was commissioned, but Leonardo kept it for himself and never returned back the painting to the patron who paid for it. You can see in the painting’s landscapes, the smile, the colours and pigmentations a testimony of Leonardo’s capacity for painting: “the only way to see behind what is visible, behind the soul, behind the emotion”... The last known drawing Leonardo did before his death is about time and water.
