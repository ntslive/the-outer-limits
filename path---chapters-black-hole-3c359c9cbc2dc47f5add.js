Inside the black hole is a point in space of infinite density and infinite gravity, from which nothing, not even light, can escape. This is known as ‘the singularity’. This episode is split into four different segments, titled  ‘Parallel Reality’, ‘Worm Holes’, ‘Time In Reverse’ and ‘The Stand Still Of Time’, all soundtracked with original music composed by Jeff Mills and featuring performances by American pianist Kathleen Supové and British violinist Thomas Gould. The guest commentator for this episode is Dr. Jameson Graef Rollins of Caltech’s Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory.",'Dr. Rollins describes the phenomenon of black holes: "Black holes are usually formed through gravitational collapse whereby very massive objects are crushed into a very small region due to their own gravity. Once an object is dense enough that even light cannot escape from its surface, there is no known force in the universe that can prevent the object from collapsing into a single point, known as a singularity. The singularity inside of a black hole is a point of an infinite curvature. The surface of no return, surrounding a black hole, is known as the ‘event horizon’. When you cross the event horizon of a black hole there is nothing capable of preventing you from falling into the singularity at its center."'],image_bg:"https://media2.ntslive.co.uk/resize/1600x1600/c30bed96-a59d-4493-b5f1-eaca648dfe48_1515715200.jpeg",credits:[{title:"Concept/Script, Main Soundtrack, Producer and Presenter",names:["Jeff Mills"]},{title:"Recorded/Edited at",names:["Spider Formation Miami/Paris"]},{title:"Guest Musicians",names:["Kathleen Supové - Pianist, Recorded at Threshold Studio, New York","Thomas Gould - Violinist, Recorded at Flesh And Bones Studio, London"]},{title:"Guest Interview and commentary",names:["Dr. Jameson Graef Rollins"]},{title:"Narration",names:["Vicente Solis – The Green Agency"]},{title:"Project Coordinator, Recording and Research Assistant",names:["Yoko Uozumi"]},{title:"Program Press Relations",names:["Elsa Sachet"]}]},gallery:[{title:"Extreme Power Of Black Hole Revealed",description:"",credits:"",imageUrl:"https://media2.ntslive.co.uk/resize/1600x1600/c3af0d6d-13dd-4e7b-8da1-45e46b5638b4_1516060800.jpeg"},{title:"Exploring the Quantum World",description:"",credits:"",imageUrl:"https://media2.ntslive.co.uk/resize/1600x1600/fa9b9020-c4e2-40aa-b347-0c863dfbe4a0_1516060800.jpeg"},{title:"Looking Back In Time",description:"",credits:"",imageUrl:"https://media2.ntslive.co.uk/resize/1600x1600/a255c426-3e00-42af-a8d2-8a9a49fed225_1516060800.jpeg"},{title:"M87",description:"",credits:"",imageUrl:"https://media2.ntslive.co.uk/resize/1600x1600/5df79254-dedf-4429-8f35-5a1c750dd290_1516060800.jpeg"},{title:"Infrared Echoes of a Black Hole Eating a Star",description:"",credits:"",imageUrl:"https://media2.ntslive.co.uk/resize/1600x1600/bba21967-3f3d-4eaf-8498-b956c886f24c_1516060800.jpeg"},{title:"Lunar Prospector Mid-flight",description:"",credits:"",imageUrl:"https://media2.ntslive.co.uk/resize/1600x1600/7029af3b-af0f-4081-aabf-55a9d9790396_1516060800.jpeg"},{title:"High-Energy Particles in Milky Way Black Hole",description:"",credits:"",imageUrl:"https://media2.ntslive.co.uk/resize/1600x1600/e959b54d-08e3-4271-a460-f34c8a27b5d3_1516060800.jpeg"},{title:"Black Hole Cygnus X-1",description:"",credits:"",imageUrl:"https://media2.ntslive.co.uk/resize/1600x1600/83a1daa5-295f-4434-b751-aec3d746f83b_1516060800.jpeg"},{title:"Powerful Cosmic Collision",description:"",credits:"",imageUrl:"https://media2.ntslive.co.uk/resize/1600x1600/30e9da5f-fb2a-461b-b418-a4b3e0ebdccc_1516060800.jpeg"},{title:"Planetary Nebula M2-9",description:"",credits:"",imageUrl:"https://media2.ntslive.co.uk/resize/1600x1600/f2d57ec4-19a7-4d23-bfe2-568904e76932_1516060800.jpeg"},{title:"Shedding Light on Dark Gamma Ray Bursts",description:"",credits:"",imageUrl:"https://media2.ntslive.co.uk/resize/1600x1600/d2ca273a-8088-46bb-a445-a42f2bd021a5_1516060800.jpeg"},{title:"SOFIA",description:"",credits:"",imageUrl:"https://media2.ntslive.co.uk/resize/1600x1600/35cfaa8f-3dc2-4ae5-989c-5d3a90961ac3_1516060800.jpeg"},{title:"A Black Hole ‘Choir’",description:"",credits:"",imageUrl:"https://media2.ntslive.co.uk/resize/1600x1600/8ea31115-a958-4605-a018-54a570be15e0_1516060800.jpeg"},{title:"NASA's OSIRIS-REx Takes Its First Image of Jupiter",description:"",credits:"",imageUrl:"https://media2.ntslive.co.uk/resize/1600x1600/6bc3e3e3-58b5-4f8b-b321-2773cfc7c450_1516060800.jpeg"}],audio:[{type:"teaser",soundcloudSecretToken:"s-rsVzS",soundcloudTrackID:"382574456"},{type:"podcast",soundcloudSecretToken:"s-rsVzS",soundcloudTrackID:"382574456"}]},{id:"apollo-18",name:"Apollo 18",broadcastDate:"14.03.2018",broadcastStartTime:"14:00",broadcastEndTime:"15:00",content:{description:null,image_bg:null,credits:null},gallery:null,audio:[]},{id:"star-people",name:"Star People",broadcastDate:"30.05.2018",broadcastStartTime:"14:00",broadcastEndTime:"15:00",content:{description:null,image_bg:null,credits:null},gallery:null,audio:[]},{id:"tba",name:"TBA",broadcastDate:"15.08.2018",broadcastStartTime:"14:00",broadcastEndTime:"15:00",content:{description:null,image_bg:null,credits:null},gallery:null,audio:[]},{id:"tba",name:"TBA",broadcastDate:"26.09.2018",broadcastStartTime:"14:00",broadcastEndTime:"15:00",content:{description:null,image_bg:null,credits:null},gallery:null,audio:[]},{id:"tba",name:"TBA",broadcastDate:"28.11.2018",broadcastStartTime:"14:00",broadcastEndTime:"15:00",content:{description:null,image_bg:null,credits:null},gallery:null,audio:[]}]}}]}},pathContext:{}}}});
