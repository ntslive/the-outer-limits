theories behind the strangest celestial object in the universe: the black hole. Inside the black hole is a point in space of infinite density and infinite gravity, from which nothing, not even light, can escape. This is known as ‘the singularity’. This episode is split into four different segments, titled  ‘Parallel Reality’, ‘Worm Holes’, ‘Time In Reverse’ and ‘The Stand Still Of Time’, all soundtracked with original music composed by Jeff Mills and featuring performances by American pianist Kathleen Supové and British violinist Thomas Gould. The guest commentator for this episode is Dr. Jameson Graef Rollins of Caltech’s Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory.\",\"Dr. Rollins describes the phenomenon of black holes: \\\"Black holes are usually formed through gravitational collapse whereby very massive objects are crushed into a very small region due to their own gravity. Once an object is dense enough that even light cannot escape from its surface, there is no known force in the universe that can prevent the object from collapsing into a single point, known as a singularity. The singularity inside of a black hole is a point of an infinite curvature. The surface of no return, surrounding a black hole, is known as the ‘event horizon’. When you cross the event horizon of a black hole there is nothing capable of preventing you from falling into the singularity at its center.\\\"\"],\"script_quotes\":null,\"credits\":[{\"title\":\"Concept/Script, Main Soundtrack, Producer and Presenter\",\"names\":[\"Jeff Mills\"]},{\"title\":\"Recorded/Edited at\",\"names\":[\"Spider Formation Miami/Paris\"]},{\"title\":\"Guest Musicians\",\"names\":[\"Kathleen Supové - Pianist, Recorded at Threshold Studio, New York\",\"Thomas Gould - Violinist, Recorded at Flesh And Bones Studio, London\"]},{\"title\":\"Guest Interview and commentary\",\"names\":[\"Dr. Jameson Graef Rollins\"]},{\"title\":\"Narration\",\"names\":[\"Vicente Solis – The Green Agency\"]},{\"title\":\"Project Coordinator, Recording and Research Assistant\",\"names\":[\"Yoko Uozumi\"]},{\"title\":\"Program Press Relations\",\"names\":[\"Elsa Sachet\"]}]},\"gallery\":[{\"title\":\"Extreme Power Of Black Hole Revealed\",\"description\":\"NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory has revealed one of the most powerful black holes known.

Inside the black hole is a point in space of infinite density and infinite gravity, from which nothing, not even light, can escape. This is known as ‘the singularity’. This episode is split into four different segments, titled  ‘Parallel Reality’, ‘Worm Holes’, ‘Time In Reverse’ and ‘The Stand Still Of Time’, all soundtracked with original music composed by Jeff Mills and featuring performances by American pianist Kathleen Supové and British violinist Thomas Gould. The guest commentator for this episode is Dr. Jameson Graef Rollins of Caltech’s Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory.\",\"Dr. Rollins describes the phenomenon of black holes: \\\"Black holes are usually formed through gravitational collapse whereby very massive objects are crushed into a very small region due to their own gravity. Once an object is dense enough that even light cannot escape from its surface, there is no known force in the universe that can prevent the object from collapsing into a single point, known as a singularity. The singularity inside of a black hole is a point of an infinite curvature. The surface of no return, surrounding a black hole, is known as the ‘event horizon’. When you cross the event horizon of a black hole there is nothing capable of preventing you from falling into the singularity at its center.\\\"\"],\"script_quotes\":null,\"credits\":[{\"title\":\"Concept/Script, Main Soundtrack, Producer and Presenter\",\"names\":[\"Jeff Mills\"]},{\"title\":\"Recorded/Edited at\",\"names\":[\"Spider Formation Miami/Paris\"]},{\"title\":\"Guest Musicians\",\"names\":[\"Kathleen Supové - Pianist, Recorded at Threshold Studio, New York\",\"Thomas Gould - Violinist, Recorded at Flesh And Bones Studio, London\"]},{\"title\":\"Guest Interview and commentary\",\"names\":[\"Dr. Jameson Graef Rollins\"]},{\"title\":\"Narration\",\"names\":[\"Vicente Solis – The Green Agency\"]},{\"title\":\"Project Coordinator, Recording and Research Assistant\",\"names\":[\"Yoko Uozumi\"]},{\"title\":\"Program Press Relations\",\"names\":[\"Elsa Sachet\"]}],\"qa\":{\"title\":\"Q&A WITH GUEST ARTISTS KATHLEEN SUPOVÉ AND THOMAS GOULD:\",\"paragraphs\":[\"How did you approach the task of musically representing the singularity inside a black hole, and how did this relate to your instrument?\",\"THOMAS GOULD: I can’t pretend that I’m any kind of expert on astrophysics or space exploration! The violin, being something like 500 years old, isn’t the first musical instrument that would spring to mind when thinking of the music of the cosmos, but it is a wonderfully versatile instrument, and subtle effects were applied to make it sound more otherworldly.\",\"KATHLEEN SUPOVÉ: I guess that I had an initial flash of an idea when I saw the respective titles, and then that flash was amplified by hearing the tracks that Jeff had already laid down. It always involved a physical gesture, at least as much as a \\\"musical\\\" motif. I guess I'm just an actor or dancer at heart… \",\"How do you think music can be best used to help people think about subjects that exceed the limits of their minds?\",\"TG: I think music provides a huge number of people an escape from the “limits of their minds”. You only have to look at how many commuters are immersed in their headphones at rush hour. Of course most of them are unlikely to be contemplating subjects that exceed the limits of their minds, but music has a unique ability to transport us from the limitations and frustrations of our actually lives and limitations.\",\"KS: I was struck by the experience of listening to this show – first of all, I hardly ever listen to radio, but it created an interesting mental space. Your mind is forced to manufacture images, but it settles down into a kind of meditative state. At some point during the show, I realized I'd \\\"gone somewhere\\\"…\",\"In what contexts do you think music is best listened to?\",\"TG: I think nothing comes close to the thrill of live music making. This is the heart of our art form and hopefully always will be. But both of my recent collaborations with Jeff have been for radio, for Radio 1 and now NTS, so that shows how important radio is in terms of creating new music, as well as spreading old.\",\"What in particular have you learned from the creative process and collaboration in The Outer Limits?\",\"KS: Well the recording session was really intense. I learned to trust my instincts and the skills I have because there was no other choice.\",\"TG: The best takes were the ones where I could immerse myself fully in the concept and switch off my critical and over-analytical side, which is always there for any classically-trained musician. So I guess I learned that you can find the greatest rewards musically when you lose yourself.\",\"What’s your next musical endeavor? \",\"KS: I'll be releasing a new album sometime this year on the Starkland label, looking to extend the piano through the use of accessories, including vocals, string manipulation, laughter, mallets and Yamaha Disklavier robotic chamber music.\",\"TG: My jazz series ‘Gould Standard’ continues at London’s Kings Place on April 13th, and before that I play a contemporary classical programme, also at Kings Place, on February 28th.\"]}},\"gallery\":[{\"title\":\"Extreme Power Of Black Hole Revealed\",\"description\":\"NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory has revealed one of the most powerful black holes known.

Inside the black hole is a point in space of infinite density and infinite gravity, from which nothing, not even light, can escape. This is known as ‘the singularity’. This episode is split into four different segments, titled  ‘Parallel Reality’, ‘Worm Holes’, ‘Time In Reverse’ and ‘The Stand Still Of Time’, all soundtracked with original music composed by Jeff Mills and featuring performances by American pianist Kathleen Supové and British violinist Thomas Gould. The guest commentator for this episode is Dr. Jameson Graef Rollins of Caltech’s Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory.\",\"Dr. Rollins describes the phenomenon of black holes: \\\"Black holes are usually formed through gravitational collapse whereby very massive objects are crushed into a very small region due to their own gravity. Once an object is dense enough that even light cannot escape from its surface, there is no known force in the universe that can prevent the object from collapsing into a single point, known as a singularity. The singularity inside of a black hole is a point of an infinite curvature. The surface of no return, surrounding a black hole, is known as the ‘event horizon’. When you cross the event horizon of a black hole there is nothing capable of preventing you from falling into the singularity at its center.\\\"\"],\"credits\":[{\"title\":\"Concept/Script, Main Soundtrack, Producer and Presenter\",\"names\":[\"Jeff Mills\"]},{\"title\":\"Recorded/Edited at\",\"names\":[\"Spider Formation Miami/Paris\"]},{\"title\":\"Guest Musicians\",\"names\":[\"Kathleen Supové - Pianist, Recorded at Threshold Studio, New York\",\"Thomas Gould - Violinist, Recorded at Flesh And Bones Studio, London\"]},{\"title\":\"Guest Interview and commentary\",\"names\":[\"Dr. Jameson Graef Rollins\"]},{\"title\":\"Narration\",\"names\":[\"Vicente Solis – The Green Agency\"]},{\"title\":\"Project Coordinator, Recording and Research Assistant\",\"names\":[\"Yoko Uozumi\"]},{\"title\":\"Program Press Relations\",\"names\":[\"Elsa Sachet\"]}],\"qa\":{\"title\":\"Q&A WITH GUEST ARTISTS KATHLEEN SUPOVÉ AND THOMAS GOULD:\",\"paragraphs\":[\"How did you approach the task of musically representing the singularity inside a black hole, and how did this relate to your instrument?\",\"THOMAS GOULD: I can’t pretend that I’m any kind of expert on astrophysics or space exploration! The violin, being something like 500 years old, isn’t the first musical instrument that would spring to mind when thinking of the music of the cosmos, but it is a wonderfully versatile instrument, and subtle effects were applied to make it sound more otherworldly.\",\"KATHLEEN SUPOVÉ: I guess that I had an initial flash of an idea when I saw the respective titles, and then that flash was amplified by hearing the tracks that Jeff had already laid down. It always involved a physical gesture, at least as much as a \\\"musical\\\" motif. I guess I'm just an actor or dancer at heart… \",\"How do you think music can be best used to help people think about subjects that exceed the limits of their minds?\",\"TG: I think music provides a huge number of people an escape from the “limits of their minds”. You only have to look at how many commuters are immersed in their headphones at rush hour. Of course most of them are unlikely to be contemplating subjects that exceed the limits of their minds, but music has a unique ability to transport us from the limitations and frustrations of our actually lives and limitations.\",\"KS: I was struck by the experience of listening to this show – first of all, I hardly ever listen to radio, but it created an interesting mental space. Your mind is forced to manufacture images, but it settles down into a kind of meditative state. At some point during the show, I realized I'd \\\"gone somewhere\\\"…\",\"In what contexts do you think music is best listened to?\",\"TG: I think nothing comes close to the thrill of live music making. This is the heart of our art form and hopefully always will be. But both of my recent collaborations with Jeff have been for radio, for Radio 1 and now NTS, so that shows how important radio is in terms of creating new music, as well as spreading old.\",\"What in particular have you learned from the creative process and collaboration in The Outer Limits?\",\"KS: Well the recording session was really intense. I learned to trust my instincts and the skills I have because there was no other choice.\",\"TG: The best takes were the ones where I could immerse myself fully in the concept and switch off my critical and over-analytical side, which is always there for any classically-trained musician. So I guess I learned that you can find the greatest rewards musically when you lose yourself.\",\"What’s your next musical endeavor? \",\"KS: I'll be releasing a new album sometime this year on the Starkland label, looking to extend the piano through the use of accessories, including vocals, string manipulation, laughter, mallets and Yamaha Disklavier robotic chamber music.\",\"TG: My jazz series ‘Gould Standard’ continues at London’s Kings Place on April 13th, and before that I play a contemporary classical programme, also at Kings Place, on February 28th.\"]}},\"gallery\":[{\"title\":\"Extreme Power Of Black Hole Revealed\",\"description\":\"NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory has revealed one of the most powerful black holes known.

Inside the black hole is a point in space of infinite density and infinite gravity, from which nothing, not even light, can escape. This is known as ‘the singularity’. This episode is split into four different segments, titled  ‘Parallel Reality’, ‘Worm Holes’, ‘Time In Reverse’ and ‘The Stand Still Of Time’, all soundtracked with original music composed by Jeff Mills and featuring performances by American pianist Kathleen Supové and British violinist Thomas Gould. The guest commentator for this episode is Dr. Jameson Graef Rollins of Caltech’s Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory.\",\"Dr. Rollins describes the phenomenon of black holes: \\\"Black holes are usually formed through gravitational collapse whereby very massive objects are crushed into a very small region due to their own gravity. Once an object is dense enough that even light cannot escape from its surface, there is no known force in the universe that can prevent the object from collapsing into a single point, known as a singularity. The singularity inside of a black hole is a point of an infinite curvature. The surface of no return, surrounding a black hole, is known as the ‘event horizon’. When you cross the event horizon of a black hole there is nothing capable of preventing you from falling into the singularity at its center.\\\"\"],\"credits\":[{\"title\":\"Concept/Script, Main Soundtrack, Producer and Presenter\",\"names\":[\"Jeff Mills\"]},{\"title\":\"Recorded/Edited at\",\"names\":[\"Spider Formation Miami/Paris\"]},{\"title\":\"Guest Musicians\",\"names\":[\"Kathleen Supové - Pianist, Recorded at Threshold Studio, New York\",\"Thomas Gould - Violinist, Recorded at Flesh And Bones Studio, London\"]},{\"title\":\"Guest Interview and commentary\",\"names\":[\"Dr. Jameson Graef Rollins\"]},{\"title\":\"Narration\",\"names\":[\"Vicente Solis – The Green Agency\"]},{\"title\":\"Project Coordinator, Recording and Research Assistant\",\"names\":[\"Yoko Uozumi\"]},{\"title\":\"Program Press Relations\",\"names\":[\"Elsa Sachet\"]}],\"qa\":{\"title\":\"Q&A WITH GUEST ARTISTS KATHLEEN SUPOVÉ AND THOMAS GOULD:\",\"paragraphs\":[\"How did you approach the task of musically representing the singularity inside a black hole, and how did this relate to your instrument?\",\"THOMAS GOULD: I can’t pretend that I’m any kind of expert on astrophysics or space exploration! The violin, being something like 500 years old, isn’t the first musical instrument that would spring to mind when thinking of the music of the cosmos, but it is a wonderfully versatile instrument, and subtle effects were applied to make it sound more otherworldly.\",\"KATHLEEN SUPOVÉ: I guess that I had an initial flash of an idea when I saw the respective titles, and then that flash was amplified by hearing the tracks that Jeff had already laid down. It always involved a physical gesture, at least as much as a \\\"musical\\\" motif. I guess I'm just an actor or dancer at heart… \",\"How do you think music can be best used to help people think about subjects that exceed the limits of their minds?\",\"TG: I think music provides a huge number of people an escape from the “limits of their minds”. You only have to look at how many commuters are immersed in their headphones at rush hour. Of course most of them are unlikely to be contemplating subjects that exceed the limits of their minds, but music has a unique ability to transport us from the limitations and frustrations of our actually lives and limitations.\",\"KS: I was struck by the experience of listening to this show – first of all, I hardly ever listen to radio, but it created an interesting mental space. Your mind is forced to manufacture images, but it settles down into a kind of meditative state. At some point during the show, I realized I'd \\\"gone somewhere\\\"…\",\"In what contexts do you think music is best listened to?\",\"TG: I think nothing comes close to the thrill of live music making. This is the heart of our art form and hopefully always will be. But both of my recent collaborations with Jeff have been for radio, for Radio 1 and now NTS, so that shows how important radio is in terms of creating new music, as well as spreading old.\",\"What in particular have you learned from the creative process and collaboration in The Outer Limits?\",\"KS: Well the recording session was really intense. I learned to trust my instincts and the skills I have because there was no other choice.\",\"TG: The best takes were the ones where I could immerse myself fully in the concept and switch off my critical and over-analytical side, which is always there for any classically-trained musician. So I guess I learned that you can find the greatest rewards musically when you lose yourself.\",\"What’s your next musical endeavor? \",\"KS: I'll be releasing a new album sometime this year on the Starkland label, looking to extend the piano through the use of accessories, including vocals, string manipulation, laughter, mallets and Yamaha Disklavier robotic chamber music.\",\"TG: My jazz series ‘Gould Standard’ continues at London’s Kings Place on April 13th, and before that I play a contemporary classical programme, also at Kings Place, on February 28th.\"]}},\"gallery\":[{\"title\":\"Extreme Power Of Black Hole Revealed\",\"description\":\"NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory has revealed one of the most powerful black holes known.

Inside the black hole is a point in space of infinite density and infinite gravity, from which nothing, not even light, can escape. This is known as ‘the singularity’. This episode is split into four different segments, titled  ‘Parallel Reality’, ‘Worm Holes’, ‘Time In Reverse’ and ‘The Stand Still Of Time’, all soundtracked with original music composed by Jeff Mills and featuring performances by American pianist Kathleen Supové and British violinist Thomas Gould. The guest commentator for this episode is Dr. Jameson Graef Rollins of Caltech’s Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory.\",\"Dr. Rollins describes the phenomenon of black holes: \\\"Black holes are usually formed through gravitational collapse whereby very massive objects are crushed into a very small region due to their own gravity. Once an object is dense enough that even light cannot escape from its surface, there is no known force in the universe that can prevent the object from collapsing into a single point, known as a singularity. The singularity inside of a black hole is a point of an infinite curvature. The surface of no return, surrounding a black hole, is known as the ‘event horizon’. When you cross the event horizon of a black hole there is nothing capable of preventing you from falling into the singularity at its center.\\\"\"],\"credits\":[{\"title\":\"Concept/Script, Main Soundtrack, Producer and Presenter\",\"names\":[\"Jeff Mills\"]},{\"title\":\"Recorded/Edited at\",\"names\":[\"Spider Formation Miami/Paris\"]},{\"title\":\"Guest Musicians\",\"names\":[\"Kathleen Supové - Pianist, Recorded at Threshold Studio, New York\",\"Thomas Gould - Violinist, Recorded at Flesh And Bones Studio, London\"]},{\"title\":\"Guest Interview and commentary\",\"names\":[\"Dr. Jameson Graef Rollins\"]},{\"title\":\"Narration\",\"names\":[\"Vicente Solis – The Green Agency\"]},{\"title\":\"Project Coordinator, Recording and Research Assistant\",\"names\":[\"Yoko Uozumi\"]},{\"title\":\"Program Press Relations\",\"names\":[\"Elsa Sachet\"]}],\"qa\":{\"title\":\"Q&A WITH GUEST ARTISTS KATHLEEN SUPOVÉ AND THOMAS GOULD:\",\"paragraphs\":[\"How did you approach the task of musically representing the singularity inside a black hole, and how did this relate to your instrument?\",\"THOMAS GOULD: I can’t pretend that I’m any kind of expert on astrophysics or space exploration! The violin, being something like 500 years old, isn’t the first musical instrument that would spring to mind when thinking of the music of the cosmos, but it is a wonderfully versatile instrument, and subtle effects were applied to make it sound more otherworldly.\",\"KATHLEEN SUPOVÉ: I guess that I had an initial flash of an idea when I saw the respective titles, and then that flash was amplified by hearing the tracks that Jeff had already laid down. It always involved a physical gesture, at least as much as a \\\"musical\\\" motif. I guess I'm just an actor or dancer at heart… \",\"How do you think music can be best used to help people think about subjects that exceed the limits of their minds?\",\"TG: I think music provides a huge number of people an escape from the “limits of their minds”. You only have to look at how many commuters are immersed in their headphones at rush hour. Of course most of them are unlikely to be contemplating subjects that exceed the limits of their minds, but music has a unique ability to transport us from the limitations and frustrations of our actually lives and limitations.\",\"KS: I was struck by the experience of listening to this show – first of all, I hardly ever listen to radio, but it created an interesting mental space. Your mind is forced to manufacture images, but it settles down into a kind of meditative state. At some point during the show, I realized I'd \\\"gone somewhere\\\"…\",\"In what contexts do you think music is best listened to?\",\"TG: I think nothing comes close to the thrill of live music making. This is the heart of our art form and hopefully always will be. But both of my recent collaborations with Jeff have been for radio, for Radio 1 and now NTS, so that shows how important radio is in terms of creating new music, as well as spreading old.\",\"What in particular have you learned from the creative process and collaboration in The Outer Limits?\",\"KS: Well the recording session was really intense. I learned to trust my instincts and the skills I have because there was no other choice.\",\"TG: The best takes were the ones where I could immerse myself fully in the concept and switch off my critical and over-analytical side, which is always there for any classically-trained musician. So I guess I learned that you can find the greatest rewards musically when you lose yourself.\",\"What’s your next musical endeavor? \",\"KS: I'll be releasing a new album sometime this year on the Starkland label, looking to extend the piano through the use of accessories, including vocals, string manipulation, laughter, mallets and Yamaha Disklavier robotic chamber music.\",\"TG: My jazz series ‘Gould Standard’ continues at London’s Kings Place on April 13th, and before that I play a contemporary classical programme, also at Kings Place, on February 28th.\"]}},\"gallery\":[{\"title\":\"Extreme Power Of Black Hole Revealed\",\"description\":\"NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory has revealed one of the most powerful black holes known.
